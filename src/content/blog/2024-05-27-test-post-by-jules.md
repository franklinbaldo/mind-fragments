## Hello World!

This is a test blog post.

If you can see this, it means:

1. The site configuration updates are likely working.
2. Astro is correctly picking up new Markdown files from the `src/content/blog/` directory.
3. The basic frontmatter is being parsed.

The purpose of this post is to ensure the fundamental file-based CMS approach is sound before automating post creation with the AI agents.

Cheers,
Jules
