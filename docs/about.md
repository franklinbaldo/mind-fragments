# About The Chronicle

This project, "The Chronicle of Franklin Baldo," is an experiment in automated personal documentation. It aims to transform Franklin Baldo's public digital activities into a cohesive, contextualized, and searchable narrative, published as a blog.

The system monitors public data sources (like GitHub, X/Twitter, and Manifold Markets), identifies significant events, and uses a chain of AI agents (initially powered by Google's Gemini API) to draft, edit, and verify articles. The entire process is orchestrated via GitHub Actions, treating content creation as a CI/CD pipeline.

This project is not just about content automation; it's about creating a living digital legacy: a dynamic and interactive record of an individual's intellectual, professional, and speculative evolution. It's an experiment in narrative self-quantification, designed to be useful not only for human readers but also as a unique training dataset for future AIs.
